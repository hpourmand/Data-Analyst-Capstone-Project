# Python-Project-for-Data-Science

We have been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting firm known for its expertise in IT solutions. Our role involves supporting the organization in staying competitive by analyzing data to identify future skill requirements. Our first task is to gather data on the most in-demand programming skills from sources like job postings, training portals, and surveys. After collecting the data, we'll analyze it to identify key insights and trends that may include the following: What are the top programming languages in demand? * What are the top database skills in demand? * What are the popular IDEs?

We will start by scraping websites and accessing APIs to collect data in formats like .csv files, Excel sheets, and databases. After collecting the data, we'll prepare it for analysis using data wrangling techniques. Next, we'll apply statistical techniques to analyze the data. We'll then use IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard, and finally, present our findings through a compelling presentation.
